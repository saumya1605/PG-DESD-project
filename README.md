# üöó Collision Avoidance System using CAN Protocol  

## **üîπ Overview**  
The **Collision Avoidance System using CAN Protocol** is designed to enhance vehicular safety by detecting obstacles and preventing potential collisions. The system utilizes **ultrasonic and IR sensors** to monitor the surroundings and detect obstacles in real-time. Additionally, a **temperature sensor** is integrated to track the vehicle's temperature, ensuring stable operation and preventing overheating. 

Communication between system components is established using the **Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol**, employing **MCP2551 transceivers** to enable efficient, low-latency data exchange between two **STM32F407** microcontrollers. The system provides immediate feedback through an **LCD display**, alerting the driver when an obstacle is detected.
